Battalia3 is an artificial dataset created using the exoplanet random generator from the online game Battalia.fr
This data set describes 2000 randomly generated exoplanets with 27 numerical attributes and their associated class.

Attributes:
- StarSpctr [INT]: Spectral type of the star the planet is orbiting
	1 : Type O
	2 : Type B 
	3 : Type A
	4 : Type F
	5 : Type G
	6 : Type K
	7 : Type M
	8 : Type L
	9 : Type T
	10 : Type Y and beyond
- OtherPlanets [INT]: Number fo other planets in the same solar system
- Position [INT]: Relative position in the system between position 1 and 10, counting empty orbits.
- SemiMajorAxis [FLOAT]: Semi-major axis in AU.
- OrbitalExc [FLOAT]: Orbital excentricity
- OrbitalInc [FLOAT]: Absolute orbital inclination compared with the star orbital axis
- OrbitalPeriod [FLOAT] : Numbers of days required to orbit the star
- AxisIncl [FLOAT]: Planet axis inclination
- Moons [INT]: Number of moons
- Diameter [INT]: Planet diameter
- Density [INT]: Planet density 
- Magnetosphere [FLOAT]: Strength of the magnetosphere (reference: Earth=100.0) 
- AtmPressure [FLOAT]: Atmospheric pressure (KPa)
- Albedo [FLOAT]: Bond albedo
- DayPeriod [FLOAT]: Lenght of the planet self-rotation in days.

- Pxxx : Atmosphere partial pressure between 0 and 100 [FLOAT] : H2O, He, CH4, H2, N2, O2, Ar, CO2, SO2, K 
- Type [CHAR]: class of the observed planet
	- "r" : rocky world
	- "g" : gas planet

Generation methodology:	
The spectral type of the star, the relative position in the system, the density and the diameter are randomly generated. From there a likely planet type is decided at random. 
All other attributes are generated or computed according to distributions based on these first attributes.
